## Exhibit 4 (Tomboy Supremacy)
![foolishness Dante](pics/foolish%20little%20girl.png)
*A thread about why tomboys are the best. What are tomboys for again? Here's a quick refresher: Tomboys are for Getting in fights with her Playing sports with her Watching kung-fu movies with her and trying to copy the moves Teasing her and laughing when she gets mad and pouts Letting her pin you so you can feel her body pressed against yours Flipping her back over so that you state into each other's eyes Protecting her from bullies even though you know she can handle herself Cheering her on and always supporting her, win or lose Throwing her a victory barbeque where you male all her favorite foods Massaging her legs, shoulders, and back Holding them close and telling her you love her Reassuring her that she is the most beautiful girl in the world when she gets jealous of the more feminine girls Accepting all of her girlish sensibilities, no matter how much she hates you finding out about them Patting her head Getting caught in the rain during a cross country run and having to huddle together under an abandoned bus stop waiting for it to pass Holding her hand in public Making her try on cute dresses when you're out on a date even though you know she'll never buy one Buying her sexy black lingerie, only for her to wear spats over them Tracing your finger over the tanlines she got during the summer and feeling how warm her skin is Having her jump into your arms and kiss you after spending time apart over vacation Introducing her to your parents Marriage Carrying her over the threshold of your new home to start a life together while she punches you in the shoulder and pouts that she can walk just fine herself Gently laying her down on the bed Whispering into her ear how much she means to you whole caressing her toned body Spending an entire night making passionate love to each other Raising a new generation of tomboys with her Loving unconditionally as you grow old together These are the things tomboys are for.*
